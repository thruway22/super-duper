    'navpd': "This chart presents fluctuations in a fund's market price relative to its Net Asset Value (NAV). NAV, set as the zero line, is the benchmark. Positive values signal a premium (market price exceeds NAV), while negative values indicate a discount (market price under NAV). This metric assists in identifying REITs valued at a premium or discount in the market.",
    'yield': "This metric displays daily variations in a fund's dividend yield compared to a normalized sector's median yield. Fluctuations above the line mean a higher yield relative to the sector median, promising better returns. Fluctuations below signify a lower yield. This allows for an assessment of a REIT's dividend performance against the sector's median, offering insights into relative attractiveness.",
    'pffo': "This chart tracks daily movements in a fund's Price to Funds From Operations (P/FFO) ratio, against the normalized sector's median P/FFO. Values above zero suggest higher valuation compared to peers, while those below indicate lower valuation. This metric enables comparison of a REIT's valuation to the sector median, offering a measure of relative profitability and potential investment value.",
    'ffos': "It refers to the portion of Funds From Operations (FFO) allocated to each share. This metric is an insightful tool for assessing a REIT's profitability per share.",
    'ffo_payout': "It denotes the percentage of FFO distributed as dividends. A lower payout ratio may suggest a REIT's potential for more substantial business growth.",
    'ffo_margin': "This is the percentage of total revenue that remains after all operating expenses have been paid. Higher FFO Margins typically signify more efficient REIT operations.",
    'ffo_roic': "It's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) using FFO. This metric measures how efficiently a REIT uses its capital to generate FFO.",
    'ffo_coverage': "This ratio assesses a REIT's ability to cover its debt using its FFO. A higher FFO Coverage Ratio typically indicates healthier financial strength.",
    'ffo_leverage': "It's the level of a REIT's debt compared to its FFO. A lower FFO Leverage Ratio usually means greater financial stability for the REIT."
